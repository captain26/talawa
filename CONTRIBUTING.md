# Contributing to Talawa
Thank you for your interest in contributing to Talawa. Regardless of the size of the contribution you make, all contributions are welcome and are appreciated. 

If you are new to contributing to open source, please read the Open Source Guides on [How to Contribute to Open Source](https://opensource.guide/how-to-contribute/).

## Ways to Contribute
If you are ready to start contributing code right away, we have a list of [good first issues](https://github.com/PalisadoesFoundation/talawa/labels/good%20first%20issue) that contain issues with a limited scope. 

### Our Development Process
We utilize GitHub issues and pull requests to keep track of issues and contributions from the community. 

#### Issues 
Feel free to open an issue if you spot any bugs or improvements you see in Talawa. Once an issue has been created, it will be triaged by the members of the Palisadoes Foundation. If passed, the issue will be open for assignment. 

As you work through these issues, you will start to get a better understanding of the type of problems that get reported. You may even start noticing the same issue gets reported. In these cases, you can close the issue and add a comment that says “Duplicate of #issue”.

#### Pull Requests
Every pull request should be linked to an existing issue. A pull request should consist of a summary, to help us understand the motivation behind the changes. 

#### Git Flow
For Talawa, we utilize the GitFlow branching model. GitFlow is geared towards efficiently tracking development and managing releases. The model makes parallel development efforts easy and safe by isolating new development efforts from completed work. 

The different types of branches we may use are:
* Feature branches (feature/branch-name)
* Release branches (release/1.XX)
* Bug branches  (bugfix/branch-name)
* Hotfix branches (hotfix/branch-name)
